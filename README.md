# mini_agenda
A mini agenda written in python 3, only for personal learning purpose...
In fact, I've been lerning three tecnologies with this mini project, four if we count GitHub...

This mini agenda was written using Python 3, SQLite and Git to manage modifications. And a bunch of spagetti code... xD

I could use this like a before and after of my learning process, maybe...

Anyway, lock and code!!
